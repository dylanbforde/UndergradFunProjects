    "In a widely-viewed gameshow at the time, Monty Hall would show contestants three closed doors and ask them to choose one. Behind one door was a valuable prize; behind the other two were goats. As soon as the contestant chose a door, Monty Hall would open one of the remaining doors to reveal a goat.The contestant was then given a final choice: switch doors or stay with the intial pick."
